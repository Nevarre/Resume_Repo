# Data Science Skills Decal Project 1

**Team Members:** Jiani Chen, Lillian Gage, Eva Newsom

**Resumes and Descriptions**  

This repo includes the resumes of the following people:

###### Jiani Chen 
* Physics major currently attending UC Berkeley. Aiming to leverage technical, problem-solving, and creative thinking skills in a mentally stimulating and challenging work environment. I'm currently doing undergraduate research on the Compton Spectrometer and Imaging (COSI) project. This instrument is designed to study astrophysical sources of nuclear line emission and gamma-ray polarization by studying the scattering patterns of particle interactions using Germanium detectors. My job is to improve the performance of Monte-Carlo simulations that is used as an analysis tool for X-ray and gamma-ray detectors. By improving the speed of the simulations and reducing the size of data gained from the simulation, it will dramatically enhance the research process of using the simulator. 
* Jobs interested in: Physics research assistant, data analyst, software engineering 

###### [Lillian Gage]
* Lillian Gage is a Senior at UC Berkeley. She is a Political Science Major. She will be graduating this December. Her studies focus on Comparative Politics and Political Economy. Before she graduates she hopes to learn more quantitative skills that will prepare her for a career in Policy Research and Analysis.
* Jobs interested in: [Policy Analyst, Policy Researcher, Policy Advocate}

###### [Eva Newsom]
* Eva Newsom is a sophomore at UC Berkeley studying Data Science. She hopes to gain a Computer Science minor as well. She is currently working with the Human Context and Ethics in Data Division at Berkeley to strive for more integration of ethics wihtin UC Berkeley Computer and Data Science curriculum. She is currently enrolled in a program for a Global Internship this summer, with the intent of working at a tech company in Singapore.    
* Jobs interested in: [Data Analyst, Software Engineer, Data Engineer]
